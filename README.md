Real time smile detection
The problem is to develop a real-time smile detection and tracking system using computer vision techniques. The system should be able to analyze video streams from a webcam and accurately identify faces in the frames. It should further detect and track smiles within the detected faces, providing visual feedback by drawing rectangles around the faces and smiles. The objective is to create a robust and efficient smile detection algorithm that can be used in various applications, such as emotion recognition, user engagement analysis, or interactive interfaces. The system should deliver accurate and prompt smile detection results, even in varying lighting conditions and different face orientations![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
